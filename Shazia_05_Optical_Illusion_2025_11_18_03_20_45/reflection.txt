(Assignment 5) Optical Illusion - Reflection 

I began by studying modular geometric patterns that could mirror the rhythmic pacing and silhouette logic of wayang shadow puppetry from my culture. Wayang relies on repetition, strong contours, and timed shifts in light to guide attention. I translated these ideas into code by building a masked silhouette reminiscent of wayang figures and filling it, as well as the background, with alternating lattices of equilateral triangles. The goal was to compose the image entirely from geometry so that recognition would depend on motion and timing rather than on drawn outlines.

The illusion’s behavior depends on discrete 120-degree rotations that advance every few seconds. This cadence helps the figure drift from abstraction toward clarity at a predictable moment. I tuned spacing, triangle size, and contrast to balance density with negative space, and ensured that every triangle rotated in sync, including hand-placed details and the procedural grid. The reveal improves when the rotation rate suits the viewer, so I added a control for tempo and considered reduced-motion settings for accessibility. Palette tests ranged from high contrast for a sharper reveal to muted tones that recall oiled leather and lamplight in traditional wayang.

This work can be deployed in several contexts. As a browser extension, it could animate during idle time, allow users to select silhouettes, and let them set the tempo so the image becomes clear every few seconds. It also lends itself to wearables. A smartwatch face could “resolve” the figure at regular intervals, while an e-ink brooch or LED scarf could cycle through the rotational states in low power. In a gallery setting, a wall projection paired with ambient audio could evoke the atmosphere of wayang staging. Across these deployments, the core contribution remains a cultural shadow form that steps into clarity through rhythm, light, and patterned motion.
